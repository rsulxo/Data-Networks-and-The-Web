# ------ INCOMPLETE - IN-PROGRESS ------ #


""" Task 3
	In this new improved version,
	you'll learn to:
		- define and index Python dictionaries
		- use one or more control statement (for/while)
		- define reusable functions (optional!)
"""

# import random module from Python standard library
import random

# define a dictionary with image urls and number of flucks
image =  ["img1" : 1, "img2": 2, "img3" : 3]

# set the served img variable to be a random element from imgs
# hints: 
#	to put dict keys in a list: list(dict.keys())
#	to choose a random item from a list: random.choice(lst)

# keep asking user if they want to fluck the image until
# they say either 'yes' or 'no'

# if they say 'yes', output a message and increment the flucks
# if they say 'no', serve another image?

# repeat process for another image...
# hint: group blocks of task-specific code into functions?
